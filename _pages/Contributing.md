- Coding standards, based on the [Google Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide) are enforced using Checkstyle. Formatters for Eclipse and IntelliJ are provided in the doc/style folder. Please refer to guides on how to import these in [Eclipse](https://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Freference%2Fpreferences%2Fjava%2Fcodestyle%2Fref-preferences-formatter.htm) and [Intellij](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2014/01/intellij-idea-13-importing-code-formatter-settings-from-eclipse/). CheckStyle plugins also exist for both IDEs.
