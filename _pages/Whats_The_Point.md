Frameworkium provides strong code structure guidelines and contains some nice 
Java libraries to make writing tests (web, mobile app, API, other tests that 
we've not thought of yet) more consistent and familiar.

It saves reinventing the wheel.

It should mean you spend less time worrying about the *plumbing*, and more 
time thinking about the actual tests themselves.
Your test projects should also stay structured, clean and **focused on the testing**,
rather than full of helpers and widgets.
